You can now request money from your users. Payments are handled through [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), and setup is extremely simple. Read all the details [in our docs](http://docs.smooch.io/javascript/#stripe).


## Changes
- The widget was fully rewritten using React and Redux. The public API is the same, but the events published slightly changed. The widget was previously publishing `message:received` and `message:sent`. Now, it only publishes `message` whenever a new message is added to the conversation. You can always check who sent that message by checking the `role` attribute for the message.
- The unread badge count was fixed to reflect the right count.
- All API calls are now made by our new library [smooch-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/smooch-core) which abstracts all interactions with our public API.
